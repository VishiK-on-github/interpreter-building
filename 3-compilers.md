# Compilers

1. AOT: translate completely before execution

The AST generated by the parser is used by the Code Generator to generate
multiple Intermediate representations know as IR. Then eventually produces
native code x86 / x64. This code gen / IR step is in static time only. During
runtime, the CPU takes the native code and generates result.

Typically:

Tokenizer -> Tokens -> Parser -> AST : falls under frontend

Code Generation -> IR -> x86 / x64 (native code) : falls under backend

LLVM helps use same backend

We need to produce LLVM compatible byte code which is performed using LLVM IR
generator (bytecode emitter). It generates LLVM IR. LLVM blackbox then generates
source codes for multiple target x86 / wasm.

2. JIT: parts of code compiled at run-time. We pause call the code generator
   compile the code to target language. Then CPU executes code. Then we jump
   back to interpreter. In the next instance we used cached version of the
   compiled code.

3. AST Transformer: Converts one AST to another. Could be of the same language
   or another. Then code generator runs and and hoping an interpreter exists for
   the generated code.
